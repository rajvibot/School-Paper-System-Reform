"## 🌱 Suggested School-Level Activities (for World Environment Day)

---

### ✍️ 1. **Plant-a-Paper Challenge**

- Every student brings one used sheet from their bag
- Writes: “What I want to grow in my life”
- Tears it up, waters it in compost trays (or garden corners)
- Bonus: Seed paper supplied = actual plants

**Tagline:**

> Let what you discard become what you grow.
> 

---

### 🧠 2. **“Write & Water” Emotional Release Booth**

- Quiet desk space with dissolvable ink (or plain paper)
- Prompt: *“Write one thing you’re ready to let go of.”*
- Drop it in a bowl of water
- Watch it vanish

**Works with:**

- Teachers, teens, even parents
- Journaling seed paper kits

---

### 🎨 3. **Craft-to-Plant Workshop**

- Origami or bookmarks made from seed paper
- Decorated with affirmations or gratitude notes
- Kids take it home or plant it at school

**Add-on:**

- “This bookmark becomes basil.”

---

### 🌾 4. **From Test to Tulsi Ceremony**

- Take one unused/discarded test sheet
- Symbolically “compost” it in a small school pot
- Add soil + seed + tag: “We learn. We grow.”
- Bonus: Pick a common herb or flower (tulsi, marigold, coriander)

---

### 📣 5. **Eco Wall of Gremlin Joy™**

- Students contribute eco-friendly hacks in their language
- Add gremlin-style truths like:
    - “Didn’t print the worksheet. Still passed.”
    - “This journal page became a tomato.”
    - “We plant what we waste.”

---

### 🪴 6. **Quiet Green Time**

- No formal activity
- Just students walking around their campus identifying:
    - What could be reused
    - Where something could be planted
    - What emotions they want to compost

**Prompt:**

> “What part of school do you want to regrow differently?”")
